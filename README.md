**Download datasets from [PlasmoDB](https://plasmodb.org), a *Plasmodium* informatics resourse**

I put together this bash script to assist me to download data from PlasmoDB
since I could not find a better way to do it.

I use [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) which can be installed using [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/wget)
or [conda](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/wget) in Linux/MacOS systems.

Several data releases are available on PlasmoDB and the most recent one can be
found [here](https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/downloads/Current_Release/).

Therefore, you can define what release you prefer to download based on the
names [here](https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/downloads/) or just choose to
go with the most recent version.
